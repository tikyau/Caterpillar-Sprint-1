# Caterpillar-Sprint-1

- I have created Azure tables, Data factory, Batch account, storage account. Created pool with start task steps. 

  I have copied modified excel files and converted file on my storage account. 

  PFA data factory template code. 
  

- Azure Table does not support space in column name. Your excel files have space in column names. E.g. Owner Division. 

  We need to change the destination to Azure SQL DB or we need to assume that there will not be space in excel file.
